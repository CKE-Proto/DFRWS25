Prompt 1: Please get a description of the attached MCP server.

Prompt 2: Thanks. Now please identify a list of all weaknesses and required mitigations for technique T1007. Please note that there may be multiple levels of transitive dependencies for a single technique. In other words, a mitigation for a weakness may itself be a technique with its own weaknesses and its own mitigations. Please provide your results in both list form as well as an ASCII tree diagram of all weaknesses and mitigations that extend from T1007.
